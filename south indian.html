      <h2>How to make masala dosa</h2>
    <p>A) making masala dosa batter

1. First take all the ingredients in three bowls:

1.5 cups idli rice or parboiled rice in one bowl
½ cup urad dal + 1 tablespoon chana dal + 20 methi seeds (fenugreek seeds) in a second bowl
⅓ cup thick poha (flattened rice) in a third bowl.<br>
        <br>
    2. Rinse the lentils and methi seeds a couple of times. Then soak them in 1 cup water for 4 to 5 hours. <br> 
     <br>  
     3. Rinse the rice a couple of times and keep aside.<br>
     <br>
    4. Rinse poha once or twice and then add to the rice.
<br>
     <br>
    5. Pour 2 cups water. Stir and soak both rice and poha together for 4 to 5 hours.<br>
     <br>
    6. Before grinding, strain the water from the soaked lentils+methi seeds and keep it for grinding urad dal.

<br>
     <br>
     7. Add the lentils in the grinder jar. Also add ½ cup of the soaked and strained water to the dal

<br>
     <br>
     8. Grind the urad dal, chana dal and methi seeds till you get a batter which is light and fluffy. The urad dal has to be ground really well, so that the batter ferments well.<br>
     <br>
     9. Remove the batter in a bowl or pan with a spatula. Here is a pic showing the consistency of the batter.<br>
     <br>
     10. Strain the rice well. Then in the same grinder, add the soaked rice and 1 cup fresh water. You can grind rice in one batch or in two to three batches. This will depend on the size of the grinder jar. I ground in one batch and added 1 cup water for grinding. You can even add ¾ cup water while grinding. Addition of water will depend on the quality of rice.<br>
     <br>
11. Grind the rice till you get a fine grainy consistency in it. The rice batter should have a fine rava like consistency in the batter. <br>
 <br>
12. Now pour the rice+poha batter in the same pan or bowl containing the urad dal batter.<br>
<br>
13. Add ½ teaspoon rock salt or add as per taste.<br>
<br>
14. Mix the salt very well with the batter. Also, mix both the batters very well. Cover and keep aside to ferment for 8 to 9 hours. You can keep for less or more time and this will depend on the temperature conditions in your city.<br>
<br>
15. The batter the next day. I kept for about 13 hours and 35 minutes as it is cold during monsoons here.<br>
<br>


<h2>Making potato masala for masala dosa</h2>
    <p>1. First rinse and then boil 4 medium sized potatoes in 2 cups water for 5 to 6 whistles in a pressure cooker. You can also boil potatoes in a pan. The potatoes have to be completely cooked.<br>
        <br>
<img src="https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/masala-dosa-recipe-restaurant-style22.jpg" alt="">
    <br>
    2. When the potatoes are cooking, soak the chana dal in hot water for 30 minutes. Then drain the chana dal and keep aside.<br>
<br>
3. When the pressure settles down on its own in the cooker, remove the lid. Drain the potatoes and let them become warm.<br>
<br>
4. Then peel them and chop them. Also, slice the onions and chop the green chilies, ginger and coriander leaves.<br>
<br>
5. Heat oil or ghee. If using cashews, then fry cashews at this step and keep them aside. Lower the flame and add mustard seeds and let them splutter. You can add ½ teaspoon cumin seeds while tempering in the potato masala.<br>
<br>
6. Then add the chana dal.<br>
<br>
7. Saute the chana dal for 2 to 3 minutes on a low flame or till they turn light golden or golden.<br>
<br>
8. Now add the sliced onions, curry leaves, green chilies and ginger.<br> saute the onions till they soften and turn translucent.<br>Add the turmeric powder and asafoetida.<br> Now add water.Again mix well and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes or till the mixture thickens a bit.<br>
<br>
9. Next add the boiled chopped potatoes.<br>Season with salt. Also add ¼ teaspoon sugar for a slightly sweet taste. You can add more sugar if you prefer.<br>simmer on a low flame to medium-low flame for 3 to 4 minutes stirring occasionally.<br>Switch off the flame and then add chopped coriander leaves. also add fried cashews now (if you have fried the cashews earlier as mentioned in step 5 above). Mix well.<br>
<br>
10.Stir and keep the potato masala aside. the potato masala should be moist and easily spreadable on the dosa. Make sure there is no water in the potato masala. It should not be of a curry or gravy consistency. This is your basic potato masala for the masala dosa.<br>

<br>



<h2>Making masala dosa</h2>
    <p>
1. Now lightly stir the batter, before you begin to make dosa. you will also see tiny air pockets in the batter.<br>Heat a cast iron pan or a flat non-stick pan. The pan should be medium hot. Smear some oil if using an iron pan or griddle. Don’t smear oil on a non stick pan, as then you won’t be able to spread the batter.<br> Keep the flame to a low, while spreading batter.<br>
        <br>
   2. Spread the batter in a circular way on the pan. on a medium flame, cook the dosa<br>Sprinkle some oil on top and edges.<br>cover the dosa with a lid and let it cook. Cook the dosa till its base becomes golden and crisp.Now fold the dosa and serve. <br>

         <h1>2.PONGAL</h1>
    <img src="https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/khara-pongal-recipe.jpg" alt="">
      <h2>How to make pongal?</h2>
    <p>A) Roasting moong dal

1. Pick ¼ cup of moong dal first to get rid of stones if any. Then heat a small pan or a small kadai and add the moong lentils.<br>
        <br>On a low flame stirring often roast the moong lentils until they become aromatic.<br> You need to roast the moong lentils until they become aromatic. There is no need to brown them.<br> Take the roasted moong lentils in another bowl or you can use the same pan for rinsing.<br>
<br>
    2. Add ½ cup rice in the bowl containing the roasted moong dal. You can use any non-sticky short to medium grained white rice. <br>  Rinse both rice and the roasted moong dal a couple of times with water.
     <br>  
<p>A) Cooking Rice and Lentils
     
3.Drain very well and then add them in a 3 litre pressure cooker.<br>  Now add the following ingredients – ½ teaspoon cumin seeds, ⅛ teaspoon asafetida (hing), 1 teaspoon heaped chopped ginger. Add salt according to your liking.

TIP: Crushing the cumin seeds lightly in your palms before adding gives a nice aroma.<br>
<br>
4. Pour 3 to 3.25 cups water. The amount of water to be added depends on the consistency you want and on the quality of moong dal.

Usually I cook the moong lentils for 7 to 8 whistles. Thus I add 3.25 cups water. If you get moong dal, that cooks faster with 2 to 3 whistles, then add about 2.5 cups water.<br>
<br>
5. Pressure cook on a medium to high heat for 7 to 8 whistles or 11 to 12 minutes. For moong dal which cooks quickly, you can pressure cook for 2 to 3 whistles.<br>
<br>
6. Let the pressure settle down on its own and then you remove the lid to check the doneness and consistency. The consistency of pongal is mushy and like a Khichdi or a porridge.<br>

Both the rice and the moong dal should be cooked very well. If you want you can even slightly mash the cooked rice and moong lentils. If cooked well, then cover with the lid and set aside.<br>


    <img src="https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ven-pongal-recipe09.jpg" alt="">

TIP: If the pongal has a consistency like that of a pulao, then add ½ to 1 cup hot water and mix very well.<br>

<br>
<p>A) Making Ven Pongal
7.In another small pan, heat 2 to 3 tablespoons ghee. 3 tablespoons ghee gives a good taste and flavor.<br>Add 1 teaspoon cumin seeds.<br>Then add 10 to 12 cashews. Fry until the cashews start to become light golden.<br>Once they begin to get light golden, then add 1 teaspoon black pepper and 10 to 12 curry leaves.<br>Stir very well and fry until the curry leaves become crisp. The black pepper should also be fried well.<br>
<br>
8.Now pour this entire tempering on the cooked rice and lentils.<br>
<br>
9.Cover with the lid (with the vent weight/whistle on the lid) and set aside for 5 to 6 minutes. This allows the tempering flavors to infuse with the khara pongal and the aroma to stay in. Then remove the lid and serve ven pongal hot or warm.<br>
