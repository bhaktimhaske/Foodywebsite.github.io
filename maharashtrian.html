      <h2>How to make puran poli</h2>
    <p>Making the puran (sweet chana dal stuffing)

1: Rinse the chana dal first very well in water. I didn’t soak the chana dal but you can soak the chana dal for 30 minutes to one hour and then drain the water.<br>
        <br>
     2: In a pressure cooker, cook the chana dal for 6 to 7 whistles. The dal need should not be mushy or pasty but cooked well. Once the pressure settles down on its own, strain the cooked dal. Keep the dal in the strainer for some minutes so that all the stock is drained. The cooked lentils have to be drained very well. Keep the stock aside. This stock can be used for making Katachi amti (thin dal) or you can just add it to your veggie dishes or rotis. <br>I did this task in batches. <br> 
     <br>  
     3: Heat ghee in a pan and add the dry ginger powder, nutmeg powder, cardamom powder and fennel powder. Fry for a few seconds on low heat.<br>
     <br>
     4. Add the cooked chana dal and powdered or grated jaggery. Stir and let this puran mixture cook on a low flame till the mixture becomes dry. Keep on stirring at intervals.

<br>
     <br>
     5. Meanwhile take whole wheat flour, all purpose flour and salt in a bowl mix well.<br>
     <br>
    6. Add a little bit of water and ghee or oil and mix.

<br>
     <br>
     7. Begin to knead the dough, adding water as required. The dough should be smooth and soft. Cover and keep aside the dough for 15 to 20 minutes.

<br>
     <br>
     8. The puran mixture has cooked now and the below photo shows the consistency which should be dry and thick. Let this stuffing mixture cool.<br>
     <br>
     9. Now mash the puran mixture very well with a potato masher. You can also use a strainer to mash the puran mixture. There is an equipment called ‘puran yantra’ which is used in Maharashtrian households to do this work, but I do not have this equipment.<br>
     <br>
     10: Take a medium or large size ball from the dough. Roll it 2 to 3 inches in circumference on a dusted rolling board. Place a portion of puran mixture in the center of the rolled dough.Bring the edges together towards the center as shown in the below pic.. Join all the edges and pinch.Sprinkle some flour and start rolling the dough. Make a medium or large circle (poli) as depending upon the size of the dough and puran filling you took. The cover should be rolled a bit thin and not thick<br>
     <br>

    <h2>Roasting puran poli on tawa</h2>
    <img src="https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/puran-poli-recipe17.jpg" alt="">
    <p>11: On a heated tawa or griddle, spread some ghee<br> Place the rolled poli/dough circle on the tawa. <br>When one side gets browned, turn over and cook the other side till you see some brown spots. <br> Once the second side gets browned, then turn over and apply ghee. If everything is done properly then puran poli will puff up. Make all pooran poli this way and stack them in a casserole or in a kitchen napkin.<br>

    <br>
    12:  You can serve puran poli warm or at room temperature with milk, ghee or curd (yogurt).<br>

<h1>2.POHE</h1>
    <img src="https://www.indianhealthyrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/poha-500x500.jpg" alt="">
      <h2>How to make Pohe?</h2>
    <p>Making pohe
1- To a strainer, add flattened rice (poha). Rinse it under running water until it turns soft.<br>
        <br>
    2- To check if it’s done, press a flake between your thumb and index finger, it should break easily.<br> 
     <br>  
     3- Add turmeric and 1/2 teaspoon salt to the poha and toss to combine. Set it aside while you make the tempering in the pan.<br>
     <br>
     4- Heat oil in a pan on medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the mustard seeds and let them pop.

Then add the peanuts and saute for a minute or two until they start turning brown.
<br>

     <br>
    5- Then add the chopped onion, green chili and curry leaves. Cook for 2 minutes until the onions soften.<br>
     <br>
    6- Add the green peas (which had been soaked in warm water for 10 minutes prior) and mix. Cook for 2 minutes until raw smell of peas goes away.
<br>
     <br>
     7- Then add in the rinsed poha and toss to combine. Taste test some poha and if it feels dry, sprinkle little water all over (I usually do that). Cook for 1-2 minutes.  Also tastes test and add more salt as needed at this point (I added around 1/8 teaspoon).

Also add the sugar (if using) and cilantro.

 </p><h1>3.UKADICHE MODAK</h1>
    <img src="https://asmallbite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Ukadiche-Modak-Recipe-1.jpg" alt="">
      <h2>How to make Ukadiche modak?</h2>
    <p>Making the sweet filling
1. Chop the jaggery and keep aside. Also grate the coconut and set aside. You will need 1 cup jaggery and 1 cup fresh grated coconut. If you do not have access to fresh coconut, then use frozen coconut or desiccated coconut. For desiccated coconut use fine grates or fine shreds.<br>
        <br>
    2. Heat ghee in a pan. Add ½ teaspoon poppy seeds. Keep flame to a low. Fry for some seconds till the poppy seeds start crackling.<br> 
     <br>  
     3. Then add 1 cup grated fresh coconut (100 grams) and 1 cup chopped jaggery (200 grams)..<br>
     <br>
     4. Mix well and cook this coconut-jaggery mixture on a low flame.<br>
<br>
 <img src="https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/modak-recipe09.jpg" alt="">

     <br>
    5. The jaggery will melt first. Cook on a low flame and stir often.<br>
     <br>
   6. Stirring often cook this mixture till the moisture from the jaggery begins to dry – about 7 to 9 minutes. Switch off the flame. Don’t overcook as the jaggery then hardens. Keep this coconut-jaggery filling aside and let it cool completely. On cooling, the mixture will thicken more.
<br>
     <br>
    7. The following is an optional step. You can add 1 tablespoon rice flour to this mixture and mix well. The rice flour helps to absorb moisture if any from the stuffing. Set the stuffing aside.
<br>
     <br>
     8. In a pan add 1.5 cups water, ¼ teaspoon oil or ghee and ¼ teaspoon salt. Keep it on the stovetop.<br>
     <br>
     9. Let this mixture come to a boil.<br>
     <br>
10.  Add 1 cup rice flour (150 grams). You can use homemade rice flour or packaged flour. Make sure the rice flour is fresh and within its shelf period.<br>
<br>
11. Quickly stir and mix the rice flour with the water.<br>
<br>
12. Stir till all the rice flour is mixed with the water. Switch off the flame. Remove the pan from the burner and keep on the workplace. Cover the pan with a lid for 4 to 5 minutes.<br>
<br>
13. Now take all the dough in a plate or thali or in a bowl. Gather the dough together and begin to knead it. The dough will be hot when you begin to knead. So apply some water on your palms and knead the dough. Knead the dough very well. If you feel the dough looks dense or hard or dry, then just add a few teaspoons of warm water and continue to knead.<br>
<br>
14. Knead to a smooth and soft dough without any lumps.<br>
<br>
15. Make small balls from the dough. Roll the balls till smooth in your palms. You can also apply some water on your palms, while rolling the balls. Keep the balls covered with a kitchen towel. The balls should not have cracks. They should be smooth in appearance.<br>
<br>

<br>
<p>Making modak without mould
16. Take a ball and flatten it with your fingers or on your palms, to a round disc or a shallow bowl shape to a medium thickness. You can apply ghee or oil in your palms, while flattening. You can keep the edges slightly thin and the center can be thick.<br>
<br>
17. Place a few teaspoons of the prepared stuffing in the center.<br>
<br>
18. Press the edges as shown in the pic below. You can also press the edges first and then place the stuffing.<br>
19. Bring together all the edges and join them. Remove the extra portion of the dough from the top, if any. Shape and taper the top of the modak with your fingers. You can also use ready modak moulds. They are usually available in shops and market some days before the Ganesh Chaturthi festival.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/modak-recipe23.jpg" alt="">
<br>
20. Make all the modak this way. Brush or grease a pan with some oil or ghee. The pan can also be lined with banana leaves or turmeric leaves. Place the shaped modak in the greased pan with some space around them.<br>
<br>
21. Take 2 to 2.5 cups water in a pot, pressure cooker or an Instant Pot steel insert. Place a trivet or a rack. Heat the water till starts to boil on a high flame. For instant pot, use the sauté option and let the water begin to boil.<br>
<br>
22. I have stacked two pans for steaming 16 modak. But you can also steam the modak in separate batches. Just cover the shaped modak with a moist muslin or cotton napkin before you begin to steam.<br>
<br>
23. Cover the pan and steam modak for 10 to 15 minutes on medium-low flame. On the Instant Pot, use the steam function on high for steaming and keep the steam vent in venting position so that the steam releases while steaming. Use a stop watch to set the time to 10 or 12 minutes. Once the ukadiche modak are steamed, you can drizzle a few teaspoons of ghee on them. Some modak may crack while shaping or steaming, but it is fine. You can forgive yourself if you are making modak for the first time.

<br>
24. The ukadiche modak are ready to be offered to Bhagwan Ganesha. Modak stay good for a couple of days in the refrigerator. While serving after refrigerating, steam them in a pan till warm or sprinkle some water on them and microwave till warm.<br>
