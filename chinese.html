         <img src="img/chi1.jpg" alt="">
         <h2>How to make sweet and sour pork</h2>
         <p>
            1.Cut pork into consistently sized pieces, about 1-inch cubes for even cooking.<br> 
            <br> 
            2.Use the standard breading technique. Coat the pork with flour, egg, then flour.<br> 
            <br> 
            3.Make sure to use a high smoke point oil for deep frying like peanut or vegetable oil.<br> 
            <br> 
            4.Maintain an oil temperature of 350 to 375°F to properly cook and brown the food.<br> 
            <br> 
            5.Deep fry the pork in batches so the pieces don’t stick and oil temperature stays hot.<br> 
            <br> 
            6.What makes this dish different than a traditional stir-fry is that it gets a light flour coating on the outside,<br> and then fried for an extra layer of crispiness. The fried pork pieces could be devoured as is, so go ahead and take a little taste before it goes into the sauce. <br> The texture is similar to fried chicken, for more crunch factor. Now it’s time to make the sauce!<br> 
            <br> 
            <img src="img/coat.jpg" alt="">
            <br>
            7.Diced onions, bell peppers, and pineapple are tasty additions to the dish. The fresh produce adds a nice bit of color and flavor. I love how the fruit compliments the sauce, mimicking the candied taste with a pop of acidity. Stir-fry the ingredients just to the point of keeping them crisp-tender.

         <h1>2.Sesame chicken</h1>
         <img src="img/ses.webp" alt="">
         <h2>How to make sesame chicken</h2>
         <p>
            1.Heat the oil in a wok or large frying pan until very hot.<br>
             <br> 
            2.Whilst the oil is heating, place the egg in one shallow bowl and the cornflour in another shallow bowl.<br>  Add the flour, salt, pepper, garlic salt and paprika to another shallow bowl and mix together.<br> 
            <br> 
            3.Dredge the chicken in the cornflour, then dip in the egg (make sure all of the chicken is covered in egg wash), <br> and finally dredge it in the seasoned flour. Add to the wok and cook on a high heat for 6-7 minutes, <br> turning two or three times during cooking, until well browned.<br>  You may need to cook in two batches (I find I can do it in one batch so long as it's no more than 3 chicken breasts).<br>  Remove from the pan and place in a bowl lined with kitchen towels.<br> 
             <br>  
            4.Add all of the sauce ingredients to the hot wok, stir and bubble on a high heat until the sauce reduces by about a third (should take 2-3 minutes). <br> Add the chicken back in and toss in the sauce to coat. Cook for 1-2 minutes.<br> 
            Turn off the heat and divide between four bowls. <br> Serve with boiled rice and top with sesame seeds and spring onions.<br> 
             <br> 
            5.Double these ingredients if you want extra sauce, rather than just coating the chicken.<br> 
            <br> 
            6.Serve with Boiled rice or try my Special Fried Rice<br>
