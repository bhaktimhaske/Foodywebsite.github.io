         <h1>1.sarson ka saag</h1>
    <img src="img/p1.jpg" alt="">
      <h2>How to make sarson ka saag</h2>
    <p> 1: chop and clean all the greens.<br> Chop off the lower end of the mustard seems just a few centimeters from the base.<br> The mustard stems can be tough. In this case you can discard the stems or keep them.<br> If you keep them, then they have to be cooked really well so that they become soft. Luckily, I had tender stems in the mustard bunch.<br>All the greens, sorted and nicely laid on the table… All going in the fridge for the saag to be made the next day.<br>
        <br>
     2: washing the greens. This is the tough part.<br> You have to really wash the greens, especially the mustard greens well to get rid of the mud or soil clinging to the stems. <br>I did this task in batches. <br> 
     <br>  
     3: add the washed greens in the pressure cooker.<br>
     <br>
     4: then add other veggies – radish, onion, tomatoes, ginger and garlic.<br>
     <br>
     5: now adding some spice & salt – green chilies, red chili powder, asafoetida & salt. <br>The saag is midly spiced and yet tastes so good.<br>
     <br>
     6: Pour water.<br>Cover and pressure cook for 6-7 minutes or more till the greens become soft.<br>You can also cook in a pan. Cover and let the greens cook till they become soft.<br>
     <br>
     7: Now let the pressure settle in the cooker. <br>When you open the lid, you will see the greens, onions, tomatoes etc all have cooked well.<br> Let the green mixture warm or cool at the room temperature.<br>
     <br>
     8: Then in a blender take some of the greens.<br>Add maize flour. The maize flour helps in making the saag smooth as well as thickening it and does impart its flavor to the saag.<br>
     <br>
     9: Blend till smooth. I usually make a smooth puree. <br>Some folks like a coarse texture. So you decide how you want your saag. <br>I blended in batches. You can also use a hand blender for the same and blend in the cooker itself.<br> If doing this then chop the greens before you pressure cook them. It is easier to blend with a hand blender then.<br> The traditional way is to use a Madani (the Indian hand blender) to blend the greens.<br>
     <br>
     10:  now pour the greens puree in a pan. I used the pressure cooker as while simmering the saag, it bubbles and splutters.<br> So be careful and use a deep pan.simmer and simmer for a good 25-30 minutes.<br> Stir occasionally so that the saag does not stick to the bottom of the pan. Check the seasoning and add more salt if required. <br>once cooled, the saag can be kept in an airtight container in the fridge.<br>
     <br>
    <h2>Tempering for sarson da saag</h2>
    <img src="img/stemp.jpg" alt="">
    <p>11: so now after this comes the final touch… The saag is not ready to be served yet.<br> We have to temper the saag. We always temper the saag with onions, but you can temper with some ginger, green chilies and tomatoes too along with the onions. <br>Heat oil or ghee and add chopped onions. <br>The amount of oil/ghee and onions to be added depends on the portions of saag you will be serving. So for 3 servings, 1 to 2 tbsp oil with 1 medium sized onion is alright.<br>
        <br>
    12: Lightly brown the onions.<br>Add the cooked sarson ka saag. Simmer.<br>
    <br>
    13:  Serve the hot sarson ka saag saag straight away with makki di roti. <br>The best is to serve with makki di roti. Nothing beats this combination. But you can also serve sarson ka saag with parathas and steamed rice.<br>

    <h1>2.Chole Bhature</h1>
    <img src="img/chole.jpg" alt="">
    <p>
        For Bhature:-<br>
        <img src="img/bhature.jpg" alt="">
        <br>
  1.Soak Semolina in ¼th-1/2 cup warm water. Semolina will make Bhature a little crisp.<br>
  <br>
 2.We will pass Plain flour and Salt mixture through a sieve. This helps remove any kind of impurities.<br>
<br>
3.Now add 1-tbsp Ghee and mix well using both your palms. Final consistency of the mixture must be like breadcrumbs.<br>
<br>
4.Add Baking Soda and Sugar and mix well. Adding Sugar helps Bhatura remain puffed longer. <br>Add soaked semolina and sour curd to the mixture. Mix well.<br>
<br>
5.Knead Bhatura dough with ¼th cup warm water. <br>Make a little stiff dough as we will be resting this dough for 4 hours and it becomes soft after resting. I have used 1½ tbsp water for kneading this stiff dough.<br> Apply some Oil on your palms and knead again with strech and pull method.<br>
<br>
6.Final dough must be a bit stiff but pliable. Apply some Oil to the dough and keep it covered in a damp muslin cloth for 4 hours.<br>
<br>
7.For frying Baturas- After 4 hours, Knead lightly and form a cylindrical log.<br> Pull out a ball shaped dough and roll each ball to remove cracks. Apply some Oil on each ball. Keep remaining dough covered in a damp cloth.<br>
<br>
8.Apply Oil in rolling board and rolling pin. With a rolling pin, roll each ball into oval shaped baturas, edges must be thick.<br>
Heat Oil in a pan for deep frying. Oil must be sufficiently hot when we put rolled bhaturas in pan. <br>While frying gently press Bhaturas so that it will rise. Change sides and fry from both sides.<br> Remove when it becomes evenly brown in color.<br>
<br>
For Chole Masala:-<br>
<img src="img/cholee.jpg" alt="">
<br>
1.Tie tea leaf in a muslin cloth to make a tea bag. Transfer soaked Chole in a Pressure cooker.<br> Add 3 Cups water, whole spices (Ingredient 15-19), baking soda, some salt and tea bag. <br>Pressure cook for 5 mins on high and 10-12 mins on low. Reserve stock after pressure cooking.<br>
<br>
2.Meanwhile, we will make a coarse masala paste of Green Chilies and Ginger root.<br> Do not use water while grinding.<br>
Heat 3-tbsp Cooking Oil in a pan. <br>Add chopped Onions and fry until it becomes brown in color. We have cooked Onions for 10 mins on medium.<br> Add coarsely ground green masala, turmeric powder and fry for 1-2 mins.<br>
<br>
3.Add Dried pomegranate seed powder and cook for 1-2 mins. Now, add chopped tomatoes and some salt for faster softening of tomatoes. <br>Mix well. Cover and Cook on low heat.<br>
<br>
4.We have cooked tomatoes for 18 mins on low heat and it has become mushy. <br>Now add dry spice powders- Kashmiri Red Chili Powder, Cumin Seeds Powder, Coriander Seeds Powder, Garam Masala Powder and Sugar.<br> Mix well. Cook this masala for 4-5 mins. Add water when masala gets dry.<br>
<br>
5.Add boiled Chole and Chole Masala Powder and mix well.<br> Add reserved stock and 1-2 cups of water and allow the chole masala to come to boil.Cover and cook on low heat for 5 mins.<br>
We will prepare a Tadka for Chole Masala.<br> Add 1-tbsp Ghee, Ginger Juilennes and slit Green Chilies. Fry for a min.Put this Tadka on Chole Masala. <br>Remove from heat and cover until served<br>

<br>
Tip# Add Ghee to Plain Flour mixture<br>
Tip# Adding Sugar helps Bhatura remain puffed for longer<br>
Tip# Always prefer sour curd. Lactic acid in curd reacts with baking soda and release CO2 which helps in rising of Bhatura dough<br>
Tip# Oil must be sufficiently hot<br>
Tip# Gently press with ladle for even steam distribution<br>
